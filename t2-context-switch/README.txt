1. Purpose and Parameters of Each Function

a) getcontext(ucontext_t *ucp)
Purpose: Saves the current execution context (registers, stack, etc.) into the provided ucontext_t structure.
Parameters:
ucp: Pointer to a ucontext_t structure where the context will be stored

b) makecontext(ucontext_t *ucp, void (*func)(), int argc, ...)
Purpose: Configures a new execution context.
Parameters:
ucp: Pointer to a pre-initialized ucontext_t structure
func: Function pointer to be executed when context is activated
argc: Number of integer arguments that follow
...: Arguments for the function (must be integers or pointers)

c) swapcontext(ucontext_t *oucp, ucontext_t *ucp)
Purpose: Saves current context in oucp and restores context from ucp.
Parameters:
oucp: Where to save the current context
ucp: Context to be restored

d) setcontext(const ucontext_t *ucp)
Purpose: Restores a previously saved context (not used in this code).
Parameters:
ucp: Context to restore

2. Meaning of Used ucontext_t Structure Fields
typedef struct ucontext_t {
    struct ucontext_t *uc_link;     // Context to resume when this one finishes
    sigset_t          uc_sigmask;   // Blocked signals mask
    stack_t           uc_stack;     // Context stack
    mcontext_t        uc_mcontext;  // Machine state (registers)
    // ... implementation-specific fields
} ucontext_t;

Fields used in the code:
uc_stack: Stack structure
ss_sp: Stack base pointer
ss_size: Stack size
ss_flags: Stack flags (0 = no special flags)
uc_link: Context to resume after this one ends (0 = thread terminates)

3. Line-by-Line Explanation of Context Manipulation

// Capture current context to transform into ContextPing
getcontext(&ContextPing);

// Configure ContextPing's stack
ContextPing.uc_stack.ss_sp = stack;       // Pointer to allocated stack
ContextPing.uc_stack.ss_size = STACKSIZE; // Stack size
ContextPing.uc_stack.ss_flags = 0;        // No special flags
ContextPing.uc_link = 0;                  // No subsequent context

// Set function to execute in ContextPing
makecontext(&ContextPing, (void*)(*BodyPing), 1, "    Ping");

// First context switch: main → Ping
swapcontext(&ContextMain, &ContextPing);

// Switch inside BodyPing: Ping → Pong
swapcontext(&ContextPing, &ContextPong);

// Switch inside BodyPong: Pong → Ping
swapcontext(&ContextPong, &ContextPing);

// Return to main
swapcontext(&ContextPing, &ContextMain);
swapcontext(&ContextPong, &ContextMain);

       makecontext(Pong)
       swapcontext(→Ping)
t1                         starts
                           prints "Ping: 0"
                           swapcontext(→Pong)
t2                                         starts
                                           prints "Pong: 0"
                                           swapcontext(→Ping)
t3                         prints "Ping: 1"
                           swapcontext(→Pong)
t4                                         prints "Pong: 1"
                                           swapcontext(→Ping)
...    ...                 ...             ...
t11                        prints "Ping: end"
                           swapcontext(→Main)
t12    continues
       swapcontext(→Pong)
t13                                        prints "Pong: end"
                                           swapcontext(→Main)
t14    prints "main: end"
       terminates

Each vertical line represents a context switch. The diagram clearly shows the ping-pong alternation pattern between Ping and Pong contexts, with main acting as the initial and final coordinator.

Key observations:
Context switches are completely deterministic in this cooperative model
Each context maintains its own execution state and stack
The program flow jumps between contexts exactly at the swapcontext() calls
Main regains control only after both Ping and Pong finish their execution
